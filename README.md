## Project Description : Handwritten Digit Recognition using TensorFlow's MNIST Dataset

This project aims to develop a handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset, which is a widely-used benchmark dataset for image classification tasks. The goal is to train a deep learning model that can accurately identify and classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

The project utilizes TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework, for implementing the digit recognition system. TensorFlow provides powerful tools and abstractions for building and training deep neural networks, making it an ideal choice for this task.

### Key Features:

1.Dataset: The project uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of a large collection of labeled images of handwritten digits. This dataset is commonly used as a starting point for beginners in image classification tasks.

2.Model Architecture: The deep learning model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of neural network well-suited for image recognition tasks. The CNN architecture is designed to extract meaningful features from the input images and make accurate predictions.

3.Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on the MNIST dataset using an iterative process known as stochastic gradient descent. During training, the model learns to adjust its internal parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual labels. The accuracy of the model is evaluated using a separate test set.

4.Prediction: Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen handwritten digits. Users can input their own images or draw digits on a canvas, and the model will classify them accordingly.
